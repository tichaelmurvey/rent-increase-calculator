# Rent increase calculator for Canberra, ACT

I built a web tool using a government API to tell people how much their landlord can legally increase their rent.

[View the live site](https://rentincreasecalculator.org/).

I wrote about the entire [experience on my blog](https://michaelturvey.online/posts/rent-calculator/).

The site uses an API request from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics API](https://explore.data.abs.gov.au/)

My friend Andrew helped me with the data request part (and helped develop the idea). You can find him [on twitter](https://twitter.com/ajdlinux).
