# Rent increase calculator for Canberra, ACT

I built a web tool using a government API to tell people how much their landlord can legally increase their rent.

The site uses an API request from the [Australian Bureau of Statistics API](https://explore.data.abs.gov.au/)

My friend Andrew helped me with the data request part (and helped develop the idea). You can find him [on twitter](https://twitter.com/ajdlinux).
